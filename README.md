# cc-pong
A little project I did to learn about [computercraft](https://tweaked.cc/).

Connect two advanced computers with modems and put the file on both (or attach a shared disk to the network) and then run `./pong.lua`

It's a little janky in some areas and probably slightly buggy still, but for a day project it's not bad.
